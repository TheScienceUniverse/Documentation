\textit{\textbf{Subject: Invitation for Placement \& Internship Offerings}}
\end{center}

It is a great pleasure to cordially invite your esteemed organization to participate in our campus placement program to consider students graduation in 2019.

The quality of education is growing up day by day with the updated knowledge of Science and Technology in every field of Computer Science. We have highly qualified teachers and coordinators as well as efficient staffs here. The students are very good as both a learner as well as developer. Students do learn the Algorithms and Coding well. Some students are good at Software and some are at Hardware. Students are doing projects on modern days World class problems under the guidance of our teachers, with having some positive results.

The form of education we need today is not just to create a set of robotic minds and fulfill their destiny; instead to have developed individual personalities including character, commitment, conviction, courtesy and courage. The main goal of our institute is to not only prepare students for their bright career in future, but also build a mindset on their skills and passions, and to serve the society and Nation as the perfect Engineers by taking the responsibility of making the Nation stronger than before with the help of innovative ideas and technologies.

Being new to the world, we are striving hard to reach the world class companies and bring the Industry and Academia closer and closer. Most of the faculty members have R\&D projects 1sponsored by leading National and International agencies and other faculty members are engaged in development of processes and software products. On the other hand, the Project works related to industries in the curriculum of the academic programme at the degree level is a major element in which the students use their previously learnt engineering skills, develop new skills and abilities. Also the previous years placement was very good. Please find the brochure attached with this mail.
